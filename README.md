# TorqueLogViewer

**TorqueLogViewer** is a web-based tool designed to visualize, analyze, and compare OBD2 datalogs from popular automotive diagnostic applications.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: View your logs on interactive charts with zoom, pan, and scroll capabilities.
- **Route Mapping**: Visualize GPS data on a map integrated with the log viewer.
- **Sensor Analysis**: Toggle individual sensors on/off to focus on specific data points.
- **Comparison Mode**: Compare two different log files or segments side-by-side to analyze performance differences.
- **Data Export**: Select and export specific ranges of data to the clipboard for further analysis or comparison.
- **Virtual Sensors**: Create custom sensors using mathematical operations (e.g., add, subtract, multiply, divide) or time-based calculations (e.g., 0-100 times) based on existing sensor data.
- **Smart Sampling**: Efficiently handle large log files with automatic or manual sampling options (Time Interval or Every N Points).

## Supported Log Formats

This viewer supports CSV logs generated by the following applications:

### 1. Torque Pro
- Standard CSV log files are fully supported.

### 2. Car Scanner ELM OBD2
- Logs from Car Scanner are supported.
- **Important**: When exporting logs from Car Scanner, you **must select the "Horizontal" option**. Vertical or other formats may not parse correctly.

## How to Use

1. **Load Log**: Click "Load Log (CSV)" on the home page and select your log file.
2. **Explore**: Use the chart to view data. Use the sidebar to select which sensors to display.
3. **Map**: If GPS data is available, the route will be displayed on the map. Click on the map to jump to that point in the chart.
4. **Compare**:
    - Select a range of data on the main chart using "Mark Start" and "Mark End".
    - Click "Export Range" to copy the data.
    - Go to the **Compare** page.
    - Click "Import Data to Chart 1" (or 2) to paste the data.
    - Repeat for another log to compare them side-by-side.

## Virtual Sensors

You can create "Virtual Sensors" to derive new data from your logs. For example:
- Calculate power if you have Torque and RPM.
- Measure time elapsed between two events (e.g., 100-200 km/h acceleration times).
